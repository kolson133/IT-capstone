                We discovered many local bars use Facebook as their sole online presence since they do not have a website. This made it difficult to find happy hour specials and their times.






                With our site we’ve brought all that information together and uniformly. We achieved this by collecting information on top rated bars through Yelp’s API and then researching when their individual happy hour’s are and what they include.






                Now our users can search and find bars that will save them money on the drinks they enjoy.
