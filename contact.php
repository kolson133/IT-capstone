                 We wanted to create a new way to look for bars in your area! We wanted out webstie to be your 
                 go to place to find all of the information you needed. This site was created for our IT-Capstone class 
                 but that didn't mean we couldn't do our very best to create something that we wanted to show the world. 
                 The three of us wanted you to enjoy our site and feel free to tell us about any fun idea you had. This 
                 project was not our first and will not be our last. Over the years we all plan to grow and become better 
                 at the things we love. This is only a small taste of what is to come from all of us. So please feel free
                 to contact us and tell us anything on your mind! Thank you for choosing us for your bar needs!
